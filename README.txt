== DESCRIPTION

Provides Capistrano deployment tasks for setting up and maintaining a CentOS server such those installed at RailsMachine (http://railsmachine.com).

Some are highly customized for my current server (nginx, runit, thin, ruby-enterprise). You should customize it for your own situation.

Use at your own risk.
